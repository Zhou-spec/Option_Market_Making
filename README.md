# Option_Market_Making
This repo is the code for my option market-making project. The option market-making project is one with the assumption that the market orders arrival intensity is linearly inverse to the bid-ask spreads. 
This setting is very nice because the optimal policy under this setting is Gaussian. However, this simple setting can generate very large bid-ask spreads, which is unrealistic. Future research will consider a more general setting.
This project is twin to the OTC market-making project. I kind of used the same technique to tackle both problems.
